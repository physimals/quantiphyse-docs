## Installation

Executables are available for Ubuntu, Windows and OSx. 

For OSx one dependency is not yet ready for high definition screens which leads to poorer resolution. 

## Basic Usage

#### Load 4D volume

PKView loads images, rois and overlays from nifti files. 

Either: 

1) Drag and drop a 4D nifti file onto the viewer

or

2) File -> Load Image

![Image 1](screenshots/1.png)

When dragging and dropping, a window will pop up to specify whether the image is a 4D volume, ROI or overlay. 

![Image 2](screenshots/2.jpg)

The image will appear in the 3 views. 
Options
- Zoom using the **right mouse button**
- **Left mouse button** click a point
- **scroll** using the mouse wheel
- Options allow scaling based on the voxel size

#### Load ROI and overlays

Drag-and-drop or load overlays in a similar way.

For overlays specify the overlay type or a generic type (as show below)

![Image 1](screenshots/4.jpg)

Switch between loaded or generated overlays from the *current overlays* section of the **Volumes** widget.

## Voxel analysis widget

- The voxel analysis widget gives the enhancement curve of the currently selected location. 

![Image 1](screenshots/6.png)

- Multiple points can be selected with multiple colors
- These points only appear on the axial slice and need to be cleared before changing clear. 
- Points can be cleared with X

## Saving images

#### Save a screen shot or plot
- Right click on an image or plot
- Click *Export*
- A view box will appear with the various format options. 
- *svg* format will allow editing of the layers and nodes in inkscape or another vector graphics viewer.

#### Save an overlay to nifti

[To write]

## Overlay options widget

- Transparency, color map and overlay threshold can be changed in the **Overlay options**. 
- Overlay statistics can also be calculated for each ROI label in the *Overlay Statistics* section.

## Curve clustering widget

- PCA based curve clustering allows clustering of tumour subregions based on contrast enhancement characteristics. 
- Number of clusters
- PCA modes used for clustering
- Advanced options: Merge clusters, auto merge clusters, get cluster sizes

![Image 1](screenshots/10.png)


## Overlay clustering widget

- Cluster based on a particular ROI map
- Step 1: Select the overlay of interest

![Image 1](screenshots/13.png)

- Step 2: Cluster based on the selected ROI. 
- Get slice and volume statistics

## PK modelling widget

- Load DCE-MRI, ROI and T10 map
- Select pharamacokinetic model
- Input image parameters
- Run modelling inside the ROI

![Image 1](screenshots/15.png)

*Still required:*
- Testing of preclinical batch t10 mapping and pk modelling
- Inclusion of Contrast-to-noise ratio restriction

## Visualisation of model fit widget
- *Additional Widgets -> PharmCurveView*
- If Pk modelling has been run or *model curves* are loaded from a nifti file then visualise the difference in parameters between the model fit and the true data.
